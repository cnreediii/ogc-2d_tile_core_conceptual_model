[big]*i.     Abstract*

This OGC Abstract Specification defines a core conceptual model for 2-D tiled structures and by extension tiling. This model is a sub-class for a more comprehensive Spatial Partitioning Conceptual Model.

[big]*iii.   Preface*

Numerous OGC standards specify some type of tiling scheme. These include Web map Tiling Service (WMTS), CDB, and GeoPackage. There have also been a number of OGC Innovation Initiatives focused on tiling and tiling schemes. However, a general tiling conceptual model for 2-D  Euclidian space has not been defined. This Abstract Specification defines that conceptual model.
